Being the main objetive of this blog to share my experiences on learning (professionally, whatever that means) 
to code and the zillions of tools available out there (for free) to help you with that, let's start by commenting on GitHub and its bots.

So far, I have:

**Advantages**
1. It's straightforward to start with 
  Ok, I know, it's not as simple as Dropbox, which is probably the most famous and used cloud for file storage, where you just drag, download
  and save stuff as a usual for Windows/Mac/Ubuntu users, but given what I heard, I was expecting a much less user-friendly environment. So far
  I had no issues on understanding how it works.
  
2. A LOT of online documentation
  Do you have a question about GitHub? There are so many online resources, basic initial lessons, foruns for discussions... Really, just
  Google it, it will be answered somewhere (one of the advantages of living on the XXI century with internet, but that's another post).
  
3. Freedom! 
  Again, comparing with Dropbox, you can put anything there, but it only edits online files with one of the Office extensions (Word, Excel...)
  I don't know about you, but I feel a little manipulated with this *clears throat* biased selection. GitHub, on the other hand, doesn't open 
  anything, as editing online is not the purpose here, so you don't have to feel bad about using the "wrong" extension for uploading your stuff.
  Ok, I'll admit, this was forced, but hey, I just wanted to say how much I love independent projects that are not in partnership with big companies
  looking for profit no matter what (I guess that's a thing GitHub is not doing anymore, but anyway, that's how it survived for a long time, 
  again, topic for another post).
  
4. you can blog from there
  how cool is that? It is another excuse for making that project you've been working on open source and share it with the community :)
  Plus, I love not having a bunch of passwords and logins for different websites, and NO, I don't want to give ALL my information to Facebook

**Disadvantages**
1. It takes some time to learn to use it
  I said it is straightforward, not trivial. For those of you already used to code, it's really no big deal, but I wouldn't recommend it to newbies.
  I know undergrad me wouldn't be happy with this at all and she would think it's a useless waste of time hahah
  
2.Private projects are paid
  Ok, I like public projects, but really? Does everything I do need to be public like this? It's not like I'm keeping things secret, it's 
  more that I'm embarassed to share everything (GO AWAY, Facebook!!), including silly mistakes.
  
That's all I can think for now, 4x2 advantages are winning and I proceed in using it. I guess once I start collaborating with people online,
I'll have more good things to talk about GitHub, as that's their main goal, to help you code with other people. Let's see about that in the 
future. See you :)
